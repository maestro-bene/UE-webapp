# UE WEBAPP Coursework Repository 📘💻

Welcome to my repository for the **UE WEBAPP** course at IMT Atlantique, where I'm diving deep into the worlds of web application programming, with LAMP stack and using Symfony. This space serves as a digital notebook and showcase of what I've learned and created along the way.

## About UE WEBAPP 🎓

UE WEBAPP (WEB APPlication) is a course designed to give students a solid foundation in developing a web application, using the LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP).
Throughout this course, I've tackled:

- The fundamentals of the LAMP stack, how each part integrates and creates a fully functional web application.
- The MVC (Model View Controller) design pattern.
- Introduction on Symfony Framework.
- General programming foundations on PHP.

## Projects and Exercises 🚀



## Tools & Technologies 🛠️

This course has me working with:
- **Nvim**: The heart of my development, providing the IDE and tools needed to build apps with phpactor as my LSP.
- **PHP**: The language chosen in this UE for app development, offering a robust framework through Symfony for object-oriented programming.
- **Git**: For version control, ensuring that every step of my development process is tracked and managed.


## Learning Objectives 🎯

Here's what I'm set to achieve:
- **End to End Application**: Building applications from scratch.
- **Data Management**: Implementing persistent data storage to keep the user's data safe.

## Prerequisites ✅

- A strong foundation in programming, particularly in object-oriented concepts.
