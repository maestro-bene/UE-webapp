# UE WEBAPP Coursework Repository 📘💻

Welcome to my repository for the **UE WEBAPP** course at IMT Atlantique, where I'm diving deep into the worlds of web application programming, with LAMP stack and using Symfony. This space serves as a digital notebook and showcase of what I've learned and created along the way.

## About UE WEBAPP 🎓

UE WEBAPP (WEB APPlication) is a course designed to give students a solid foundation in developing a web application, using the LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP).
Throughout this course, I've tackled:

- The fundamentals of the LAMP stack, how each part integrates and creates a fully functional web application.
- The MVC (Model View Controller) design pattern.
- Introduction on Symfony Framework.
- General programming foundations on PHP.
